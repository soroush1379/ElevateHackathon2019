This program detects empty parking spots or empty chairs in public spaces using surveillance cameras. 

In this project we developed a project using Python and Swift which uses the video footage captures by the CCTV camerasÂ  to count the number of empty seats in libraries and restaurants. The result is shown in an IOS app to the user. Hence, the user can know before hand using this app if there are any empty seats at their destination.
